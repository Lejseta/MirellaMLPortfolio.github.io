1. Business understanding:

The objective of a model is to forecast monthly airline passenger numbers to help with revenue forecasting, and capacity planning.

2. Dataset Overview & Issues

- Thhe Dataset contains 144 records
- Columns: Month, Passenger count

Issues:
- Small Dataset
3. Pre-processing
- Convert the 'Month' column into datetime format
- Normalisation: Scales values to [0,1] range

Version 1:
Model used: LSTM
Experiments with a smaller number of epochs and batch size:
-  epochs: 200,
-  batch_size: 1

Train RMSE: 10.95
Test RMSE: 44.95

Problem: Overfitting 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2:
- batch_size:16
- epochs: 500

- Added dropout: 0.2-0.3


Training Metrics:
RMSE: 26.96 
MAE: 21.33

Test Metrics:
RMSE: 40.41
MAE: 34.01


- Dropout and early stopping prevented memorisation of training patterns (overfitting) - stopped at the optimal epoch
- Bidirectional LSTM instead of single LSTM captured complex temporal relationships
- Test error decreased significantly (reduced overfitting)
- Training error increased (intentional regularisation)
----------------------------------------------------------
Version 3:
- Increased Dropout: 0.3-0.4
Training Metrics:
RMSE: 27.18 
MAE: 20.72

Test Metrics:
RMSE: 37.29 
MAE: 31.60

- Training error slightly increased (more regularisation).

- Test error improved further (better generalization).
